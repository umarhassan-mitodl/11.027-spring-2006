*Assignment 1* 

Can you think of three planning topics that interest you? What do you want to know more about? Is there a problem that you want to see fixed? Can Boston learn from Copenhagen? Can Copenhagen learn from Boston?

\- Create a 5 minute visual presentation (not too many words please, mostly images) on a planning issue of interest to you. Try to focus on Boston and Copenhagen as you think about your issue. You should pull images from places like Google{{< sup "TM" >}} image or the various Boston and Copenhagen Web sites available. Students will pick a time to present over the next two classes.

\- As part of preparing your presentation, you will most likely have a few questions about topics, Denmark and yourself. Write down all of these questions in your research notebook. Then, pull out at least 5 questions for our Guest Jacob Friis from the Royal Danish Consulate, Boston.

Make a list of 5 people that you could talk to about your topic idea here in the U.S. Write a paragraph on each person describing their backgrounds. These people can be DUSP faculty, DUSP alumni/ae or other individuals. The instructors can help with suggestions. This is a good time to set up an interviewing time with 1 or 2 of these people. Remember they all have busy schedules and you need to interview at least 1 by Week #5.

\- 2-3 paragraphs describing the issue you intend to study in Boston and Copenhagen and the motivation behind studying it.    
\- 2-3 paragraphs describing the method you will use to discover information about your issue (e.g., library research, observation, mapping, census, etc.).

*Assignment 5*

Now that you have written your 1 page proposal and you have interviewed an expert, you need to begin focusing on your research angle when you get to Copenhagen. We can use writing as a way to focus and shape your ideas. Craft a written 2-page paper that discusses the history of the issue as it is being addressed in Copenhagen. Structure the paper as follows:

\- 2-3 paragraphs on the history of the issue in Copenhagen.    
\- 2-3 paragraphs on the current thoughts on your issue in Copenhagen.    
\- 2-3 paragraphs on the method you plan to use to study the issue in Copenhagen.

Include at least 3 references (only one of which can be a Web site).
